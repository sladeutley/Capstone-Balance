Balance is a self-improvement productivity app that keeps track of a user’s goals based on specific categories( i.e. social life, work, music, etc.) that they want to pursue. These categories are visually represented by a pie chart that the user can click on to add a new goal. The pie chart also shows the progress a user has made by filling in with color that section’s area the more goals a user has completed in that category.
